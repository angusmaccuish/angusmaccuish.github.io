<!-- l. 3 --><p class='noindent'>Our aim is to describe algorithms which speed up the
FRTB<span class='footnote-mark'><a href='index4.html#fn1x2'><sup class='textsuperscript'>1</sup></a></span><a id='x3-2001f1'></a> 
standardised approach (SA), specifically the sensitivities-based
method (SBM). We assume that the reader has a familiarity with the

the regulations, should refer to:

<!-- l. 12 --><p class='noindent'>This text should be regarded as a supplement to the FRTB specification, and as such you will
not find any definitions, nor will you find tables of risk weights or correlation values. These
would just be a copy of those presented in the official documentation, and a pointless
re-hashing of information which is very well explained at source. Our goal is to take the
fundamental SBM formulae and convert them into fast algorithms, which can be implemented
by practitioners.
</p><!-- l. 17 --><p class='noindent'>To quote the specification:
     </p><blockquote class='quote'>
     <!-- l. 20 --><p class='noindent'>“The sensitivities of financial instruments to a prescribed list of risk factors
     are used to calculate the delta, vega and curvature risk capital requirements.
     These sensitivities are risk-weighted and then aggregated, first within risk
     buckets (risk factors with common characteristics) and then across buckets
     within the same risk class”</p></blockquote>
<!-- l. 25 --><p class='noindent'>The above paragraph summarises our task: to aggregate the various risk-weighted sensitivities
                                                                                

                                                                                
at the bucket level (<span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>intra</span>-bucket) and then across all the buckets (<span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>inter</span>-bucket), for the
following risk classes:
</p>
     <ul class='itemize1'>
     <li class='itemize'>General interest rate risk (GIRR)
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>Credit spread risk (CSR): non-securitisations
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>CSR: securitisations (non-correlation trading portfolio, or non-CTP)
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>CSR: securitisations (correlation trading portfolio, or CTP)
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>Equity risk
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>Commodity risk
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>Foreign exchange (FX) risk</li></ul>
<!-- l. 38 --><p class='noindent'>The risk charge for each risk class is defined as the sum of the delta, vega and curvature
positions, and calculated for each of the following stress scenarios: low, medium and high
(where each scenario specifies different intra-bucket and inter-bucket correlation coefficients).
Summing over all risk classes, the largest of the low/medium/high scenario charges is selected
as the total risk charge.
</p><!-- l. 43 --><p class='noindent'>It should be understood that this calculation is executed in a particular context. For example
we may want the total portfolio risk charge, which necessitates aggregating <span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>all </span>the in-scope
trade positions. Or perhaps we need to compute the desk-level capital charge, which would
require partitioning the trades by desk before performing the calculation on each dataset. If we
are asked to compute the risk charge per book, this may involve hundreds, possibly thousands
of individual book calculations. In the latter case, even if each calculation has a tolerable
                                                                                

                                                                                
execution speed, this can still lead to long running computations when the number
of books is large. We will show that it is possible to compute <span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>all </span>the individual
results in one bulk calculation, the only requirement being that each subset of data
is ‘tagged’ with a unique identifier in order to distinguish it from the others (we
will refer to these individual subsets as ‘groups’). Note that if the request spans
multiple business dates, then handling each date separately is advised if allowance is
to be made for risk weights and correlations varying over time, due to regulatory
changes.
</p><!-- l. 54 --><p class='noindent'>In the chapters which follow, we describe the generic intra-bucket and inter-bucket aggregation
algorithms, then discuss details specific to each risk class.
