<!-- l. 3 --><p class='noindent'>There are three key components in any FRTB implementation:
</p>
     <ul class='itemize1'>
     <li class='itemize'>Generation of the daily risk values
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>ETL process to load the risk values + trade attributes into an aggregation engine
     </li>
     <li class='itemize'>Aggregation engine which computes the risk positions and overall capital charge
     across required dimensions</li></ul>
<!-- l. 11 --><p class='noindent'>The question then arises as to how to source the risk weights, correlation coefficients and other
calculation parameters, for a given business date and regulatory regime. Some systems, such as
the ActiveViam FRTB Accelerator (built on top of their ActivePivot OLAP cube technology)
load this via property files. With such an approach, the data in each property file is tagged
with ‘valid from’ and ‘valid to’ dates, to allow for the possibility of these values being
date-specific.
</p><!-- l. 17 --><p class='noindent'>Despite being typically very static, the alternative approach of adding this data to the ETL
stage has merit. For a start, it greatly simplifies the aggregation engine: since the
configuration is treated as input data, on a par with the daily risk values, it is not
something that has to be looked up and/or derived (or worse still, hardcoded in the
implementation). There is also a benefit in having this data siloed and owned by
a distinct team, whose responsibility is keeping abreast of regulatory changes. It
is better to have a business user publish a parameter update in some upstream
system, rather than have a developer modify a properties file in the aggregation
engine.
</p><!-- l. 24 --><p class='noindent'>So much for the input data and calculation parameters, what of the calculation itself?
While it may be possible to shoehorn the required inputs for each risk class into a
unified scheme - which would allow the risk values to be received in one large dataset
- it’s desirable to split these up by risk class and risk type, e.g. FX delta, GIRR
Vega, etc. These would then be passed individually to the analytics library, along
with the risk weights, correlations and calculation parameters. The output from
the library will obviously be discretised at the same level, for each stress scenario,
                                                                                

                                                                                
which leaves the aggregation engine to combine the results and compute the final
capital charge. This will also involve choosing between the low, medium and high
scenarios.
</p><!-- l. 32 --><p class='noindent'>The downstream users of the system will typically use MDX queries and/or Excel XMLA
requests to view the results.
